# ToDo List by Andoni Lalanne-Berdouticq (Akeops)

Welcome to my ToDo List project! This project is a personal endeavor by me, Andoni Lalanne-Berdouticq, also known on GitHub as [Akeops](https://github.com/Akeops). I started working on this project in April 2024 as a way to refine and showcase my development skills.

## Project Overview

The ToDo List is being developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, focusing on simplicity, efficiency, and usability. The main functionality of the app includes adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. All tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your to-dos are saved between sessions without the need for a backend database.

### Why This Project?

As a developer, continuously improving and challenging oneself is crucial. This project serves as a personal challenge to enhance my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows me to experiment with new ideas, implement features from scratch, and ultimately, improve my competencies in web development.

### Current Progress

As of now, the project is in the development phase. Having laid the groundwork for task management and localStorage integration, my next focus is on the frontend aspect. This includes designing a user-friendly interface, adding interactive elements, and ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

### Features

- **Task Management:** Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete with ease.
- **Persistence:** Tasks are saved in localStorage, making sure you never lose your progress.
- **UI/UX:** A focus on clean, responsive design for an optimal user experience.

### Upcoming Features

- Improved task categorization (completed)
